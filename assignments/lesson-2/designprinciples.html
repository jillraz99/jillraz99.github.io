            <p>Consumer Cellular has done a great job with alignment. The paragraphs
                have strong left alignment, information on the different options are in boxes
                that are lined up with each other, and headings are all aligned. The lines on
                either side of the headers all align and the icons align with each other and
                the other text on the page.

            <p>This site is a great example of repetition. The same blue and yellow color
                scheme is found throughout the site. All the butons are bright yellow. The
                titles are all in the same font and all caps. Paragraphs are in the same
                font. Icons are all styled with simple line drawings that are very similar
                in style and size. Everything is center aligned, bringing continuity
                throughout the site.

            <p>This site has different sections that are clearly defined with different
                backgrounds and lots of white space separating them. The paragraphs are
                tight, so the user can easily see the different sections that belong
                together. The visual diagram is simply grouped together. The opening
                page makes it clear where to start and the footer at the bottom has all
                the icons togehter and lined up.
