                    <h2>St. George Utah temple closed for renovations</h2>
                    <p>The St. George Temple closed on November 4th, of this year and will remain closed until its expected completion in 2022 as extensive structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and finish work will be comopleted. Detailed plans were recently released concerning the renovation. "This is one of the beautiful, premier temples in teh Church,"said Brent Roberts, managing director the Church's Special Projects Department. "Latter-day Saints have worshipped here for almost 150 years. However, the building has worn out over time, and it is once again time for us to refresh and strngthen this historic structure for futre generations to enjoy."</p>
                    <p>At a recent news conference, Church representatives shared interior and exterior site plans, including renderings for the entire temple block rennovation. There will be new walkways, landscaping, water features and additional shade trees. A new brides' exit and plaza will be added to the east side of the annex, and a new baptistry entrance and exit will be added on the temple's south side. In addition, the upper portion of the existing annex will be demolished and replaced with a design that will match the existing historic style that is currently on the temple now. The structure will be upgraded seismicaly by adding steel to the temple's original wood trusses and it will also receive new heating and cooling systems.</p>
                    <p>"The St. George Temple represents the devotion, sacrifice and faith of early members of the Church. This temple was built by hand in the desert as an expression of theier faith, said Emily Utt, historic sites curator for the Church History Department. "We believe the current plans to preserve, restore and renovate this sacred place will honor those who came before while also improving the temple's safety and function for patrons." The St. George temple has a large geographical area of saints it serves from southwestern Utah through parts of Nevada and Arizona. During the construction, nearby temples in Cedar City, Utah and Las Vegas, Nevada will serve those patrons.</p>
                    <p>Temple Inn and Suites will continue to offer all of our usual services during the St. George
                        three year closing. For more information concerning the closing and to see renderings of the new
